### Description
This repo is for educational only purposes, It is a playground for writing low-level code,
and understanding Computers, pointers, and memory management, Every file must have lots of comments
to describe the code, and algorithms.

### Files
Here is a brief description for every C file in this repo

- `stack.c` Stack impl
- `dynamic_array.c` Dynamic array in c (NOT COMPLETED)
- `string.c` String impl in c (similar to String struct in rust) (NOT COMPLETED)
- `print_str.c` A function for printing c string to stdout (learning pointer arithmetics)
